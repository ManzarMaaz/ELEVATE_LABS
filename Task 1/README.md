# Task 1: Simple Command-Line Calculator CLI App ðŸ§®
This project implements a basic calculator application accessible via the command line. It supports the four fundamental arithmetic operations and demonstrates the use of Python functions, loops, and user input handling.

## Deliverables
calculator.py

## Features
Operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).

Looping: The application runs in a loop, allowing continuous calculations until the user chooses to exit.

Error Handling: Includes a try...except block to handle non-numeric inputs (ValueError) and a specific check for division by zero (ZeroDivisionError).

Functions: Each operation is implemented as a separate function (add,Â subtract,Â multiply,Â divide), promoting code reusability and structure.

## How to Run
Save the file: Ensure the file is saved as calculator.py.

Open Terminal: Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

Execute: Run the script using the Python interpreter:

```bash
python calculator.py
```
Follow Prompts: Select an operation (1-5) and enter the required numbers.

## Key Concepts Utilized
Functions: For modular code structure.

while Loop: To keep the application running.

Conditionals (if/elif/else): To manage user choices and operation selection.

User Input (input()): For interactive CLI use.

Type Casting: Converting input strings to float for calculations.
